# Switch-to-Sleep
A build idea to operate an electrical from in a room a little distant away from it

# Intention behind the build
To control an electrical switch in the switch board from a distance away from it.
# The story behind the evolution of build’s idea
As age grows, there are obviously many changes that take place in the human body. One such thing is sleeplessness. Decrease in sleeping hours will eventually affect the body physically and mentally.
Such people would read books on bed to fall asleep soon. But, as soon as they feel sleepy and attempt to sleep, one thing that disturbs them is the light. Until then, there is a need of light in order to read books, but, as soon as they wish to sleep, it should get turned off. But, if one gets up from the bed to turn switch off, the feeling of falling asleep will soon get vanished. So, the need here is to control a distant switch from the bed without getting up from bed.
# Journey of Build
A pin is attached firmly to the switch with the help of double-sided foam tape and then it is covered with transparent tape to ensure complete rigid fixture looks as mentioned below

Then threads are pulled from the top and bottom of the pin to turn it off and on.

Here is where a loop hole observed is that the switch can’t be operated if it distant from the place where it is desired to be controlled.
Involving the concepts of Mechanical Design & 3D Printing, I got to make the models of required pulleys on Fusion 360 and then got them 3D printed.

And then, attached the thread over the pulley and then the issue was cleared. Now, the switch can be operated even if the place of control is distant from the switchboard.Using pulley will result in change in the direction of force action and thus making the brainstormed idea come true.



To mention about its strength, the present idea is just a prototype which could accomodate many changes to make it more reliable.

I whole heartedly thank each and every one who are behind the frame work of Fracktal Works’ Innovative Engineering Course and the whole learning community. It really bought an innovation in an ordinary mind.
